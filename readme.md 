## Triple Triad Final Fantasy 8 Tribute 

- I'm hoping to build a web app which emulates the triple triad mini game from FF8 using python and react. 
- I envision having the server dealing with the logic of the game and also the eventual planned ai. 

#### First commit 9 Nov 20 
- Created classes for cards, the deck, and the board itself
- Tested whether the deck builds and board accepts cards into position

#### Second commit 10 Nov 20 

- core functionality of the board and game are now working 
- added player class
- successfully demonstrated an attack/card flip 

#### To do next 
- finish all the attacking routes
- apply scoring 
- clean up ability to see state of the board - another dict perhaps
