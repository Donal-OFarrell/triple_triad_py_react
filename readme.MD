## Triple Triad Final Fantasy 8 Tribute 

- I'm hoping to build a web app which emulates the triple triad mini game from FF8 using python and react. 
- I envision having the server dealing with the logic of the game the CPU ai. 

### Completed 
- Offline game works as terminal based command prompt game - where the AI can dominate based on card selection RNG

### In progress
- I've now began work on the Django API 
- In parallel I'm working on the UI, as some of the routes require back to front testing (RIP branching naming convention :) )
